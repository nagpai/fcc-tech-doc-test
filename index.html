        <ul>
          <li>Composting helps manage household waste and reduce burden on urban landfills</li>
          <li>It also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and spread of diseases because of bad microbes growing on waste</li>
          <li>The composting process gives useful byproducts like fertile garden soil and liquid fertilizer / declogger </li>
          <li>The Bokashi method, among many others, is most suited for small urban homes </li>
        </ul>

        <p>An average family of four generates about 5 to 10KG of solid kitchen waste daily. If the waste is left to decompose in air, it generates foul odour and even becomes a breeding ground for pathogens and cause epidemics. Openly rotting kitchen waste also generates Methane and other greenhouse gases bad for the environment. Imagine if hundreds of family in a locality, and thousands together in a city dispose this waste directly to the landfills. we have many many tonnes of waste getting accumulated over a short period of time. Imagination aside, this problem is very real in most large cities where waste management has turned into a big problem.</p>

          <p>The good news is that kitchen waste can be turned into useful by products as garden compost / soil, and liquid fertilizer. The trick is doing it with a simple yet methodic process of degeneration, or home based composting. While there are various methods to compost and break down waste, the Japanese Bokashi method is by far very popular due to its speed and effectiveness. The method also requires very less space and is ideal for small urban apartments where space is a constraint. </p>

        <code>
          Average household of 4 members generates approximately 200kg of solid vegetable waste each month.

          You can only imagine how much that adds up for a large city, and the environmental hazard it brings about.

        <p>Microbes, like humans, can be good or evil. The good microbes, also called probiotic, help break down waste into useful materials. They also help in other useful process, for example - Yeast in making bread, or Lactobacillus which helps make yogurt. There are also two types of bacteria - Aerobic and Anaerobic. Aerobic bacteria require fresh air and oxygen to survive and tend to generate harmful and smelly gases if they are allowed to act upon waste directly. Anaerobic bacteria hate oxygen and like dark and shut places. They help in degenerating waste to whats called a 'pickle', without releasing harmful gases and very less odours.</p>

        <header>The Bokashi Bin method</header>
        <p>A Bokashi Bin requires a bin of a size ranging from a small dustbin to a large plastic barrel depending on the waste you generate and the scale you need. For most households, a standard dustbin size is a good start. There are ready made Bokashi kits available on popular online sites too. The kit also would include a special Bokashi Bran powder which contains probiotic bacteria (similar to yeast) which helps break down the waste and pickle it. The bin would need a tap at the bottom to drain out liquid fertilizer that gets generated regularly</p>

        <code> The Bokashi Bin is one of the many awesome gifts of the Japanese to the world. It is ideal for small apartments and ensures odourfree and quick composting of kitchen solid waste.
        </code>

        <p> The Bokashi bin also has an intermediate filter at the bottom to separate the liquid fertilizer from the rest of the compost / pickle mass. </p>

        <header>Steps to Compost</header>
        <p>You will need the following materials to start off:</p>
        <code>
          <ul>
          <li>An empty bin with a tap attached at the bottom. the bin should have an airtight lid</li>
          <li>A sieve net filter</li>
          <li>Some paper, newspaper would do just fine</li>
          <li>Bokashi bran powder</li>
          <li>Handgloves and other hygiene measures</li>
        </ul>
        </code>

        <p>Steps to setup the compost bin</p>

    <h3>A. Pickling of waste</h3>
    <code>
      <ol>
        <li>Clean up the bin from inside and attach a tap at its bottom.</li>
        <li>Make sure the tap is well sealed to avoid leakage of liquid fertilizer</li>
        <li>Place the sieve filter covering the whole radius of the bin inside, and fixed with a gap of about 4 to 6 inches between the bottom of the bin to the sieve. This room allows liquid fertilizer to drain and collect</li>
        <li>Place a layer of paper / newspaper and add about two tablespoons of Bokashi bran spread across the base.</li>
        <li>Get your kitchen waste. Spare some time to make the waste into fine pieces for better composting.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of about 2 inches of waste and spread two tablespoons of Bokashi bran over it. Spread the bran evenly, sprinkling using a spoon.</li>
        <li>Top it up with the next 2 inches of waste and repeat the process of adding two tablespoons of Bokashi bran every 2 inches.</li>
        <li>Make sure the bin is shut airtight after adding waste/ bran layer. The anaerobic Bokashi bacteria do not like oxygen and light</li>
        <li>Once the bin is full, leave it shut for about 3 weeks. Every 3 days drain out liquid fertilizer from the tap, that gets generated in the process of composting</li>
        <li>This liquid fertilizer can be diluted 1:30 proportion in water and can be used to water plants. The fertilizer can also be washed down sumps and drains since it acts as an awesome drain declogger over a period of time.</li>
      </ol>
      </code>

      <h3>Aerobic composting of pickled waste</h3>

      <p>After about 3 weeks of keeping the bin closed and draining the liquid fertilizer (also called Bokashi tea), the waste would be sufficiently degenerated by anaerobic bacteria. It is now what's termed as picked waste. It would have a mild sweet-sour odour, certainly not as severe as openly rotting waste. This pickled waste needs two to three week more treatment by aerobic composting</p>
    <code>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the bin. Make sure you have gardening gloves on for hygiene.</li>
        <li>Take another larger dry bin (without any holes)</li>
        <li>Keep filling this second bin with alternate layers of 3 inches of pickled waste, and another three inches of compost, gardening soil, or coco-peat (available through gardening depots). If you are doing the first cycle, you can use coco peat and for the subsequent cycles you can use the compost you get at the end of this cycle</li>
        <li>When the waste is all layered, cover it with a lining of newspaper and keep this bin in a rather open space for about two to three weeks</li>
        <li>At the end of three weeks, the waste would have completely degenerated to nice soil grade compost</li>
      </ol>

      <section class="main-section" id="Compost_Cycle">
        <header>Compost Cycle</header>
        <p>If we look back the whole cycle of composting involves two major stages - Anaerobic composting and Aerobic composting.</p>

        <h4>Anaerobic composting stage</h4>
        <p>Anaerobic bacteria are one of the greatest marvels of nature, since they can survive without oxygen, even in perfect vaccum in outer space. Back to composting, they can work wonders by degenerating waste initially without releasing toxic gases and odours. The bacteria in  Bokashi bran is also probiotic, that does not cause harmful health hazards. The action of Anaerobic bacteria brings the waste to a safe state to feed the Aerobic bacteria. If fed directly, Aerobic bacteria causes terrible odour, greenhouse gases, and even outbreak of diseases. However the waste we get after the Anaerobic stage is perfectly safe and odour free while it further breaks down through the Aerobic stage</p>

        <h4>Aerobic composting stage</h4>
        <p>Aerobic composting involves using bacteria that rely on oxygen and air. They help in further breaking down the pickled waste into pure compost which resembles and is usable like Garden soil. This process too takes about two weeks and requires mixing the pickle with compost from earlier stages, or agents like coco-peat.</p>
